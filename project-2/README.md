In this project, you will have to implement B+tree indexes for Bruinbase and use them to handle SELECT queries. Towards this goal, you will first download, build, and play with Bruinbase to get familiar with it. You will then go over its overall system architecture and the source code to learn its internals. Finally, you will implement the code for the B+tree index and modify its SQL engine to make Bruinbase use a B+tree for query processing.
